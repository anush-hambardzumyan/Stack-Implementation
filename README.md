# Stack-Implementation

A **stack** is a linear data structure in which the insertion of a new element and removal of an existing element takes place at the same end represented as the top of the stack.


**LIFO( Last In First Out ) principle:**    
This strategy states that the element that is inserted last will come out first. You can take a pile of plates kept on top of each other as a real-life example. The plate which we put last is on the top and since we remove the plate that is at the top, we can say that the plate that was put last comes out first.
Among the many useful methods of stack class that C++ provides, the most common are push, pop, empty, size, and top.

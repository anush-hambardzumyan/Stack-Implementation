# Stack-Implementation

Stack was implemented by using templates. 
Also were used 2 header files: 
"prototypes.hpp" --> includes all the prototypes of methods and definition of MyStack class.
"implementations.hpp" --> includes all the implementations.
I implemented following methods.
1.push()
2.size()
3.top()
4.pop()
5.empty()
6.print()
also constructor and destructor for class objects.
